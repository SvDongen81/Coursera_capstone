I want to find out if this ordering will be more reflective of the continent in which a city is located.\n\nThis can be helpfull for anyone looking for international bussiness opportunities. Someone who has has succesfull bussines ventures in one Capital might concentrate his next adventures in cities within the same cluster, so as to make good use of his cultural experiences."

However, we only need the comparative frequency of different venues and there is no reason to think that those frequencies will be affected by those problems.\nThe coordinates of the capitals comes from the website http://techslides.com/list-of-countries-and-capitals"
